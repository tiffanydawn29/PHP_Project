#Bookish App
This project is an app that is a  book entry journal. 
It's functionality will keep track of all books read and then gives a place to enter them into a database for future retrieval.


## Project Status Update - Assignment 7 addition  

- All features are currently implemented, except for displaying data from the database.  

- I have been keeping an eye on the discussion page, but I havenâ€™t seen feedback from any other students, so I can only work on what I know I need to work on  

- Utilizing strategies from Chapter 12 in the textbook, my app needs to get and display data from the database  

**Next Steps:**

- Implement the rest of the database code within the next 2 weeks
