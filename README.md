#Bookish App
This project is an app that is a  book entry journal. 
It's functionality will keep track of all books read and then gives a place to enter them into a database for future retrieval.


## Project Status Update - Assignment 7 addition  

- All features are currently implemented, except for displaying data from the database.  

- I have been keeping an eye on the discussion page, but I haven’t seen feedback from any other students, so I can only work on what I know I need to work on  

- Utilizing strategies from Chapter 12 in the textbook, my app needs to get and display data from the database  

**Next Steps:**

- Implement the rest of the database code within the next 2 weeks  

## Week 11 Addition from Assignment 8

- **Added Deployment Branch:**
  - Created a deployment branch for the assignment.

- **Folder Setup:**
  - Created a folder named `dgl123` on AWS.

- **Project Files:**
  - Added assignment files to the `dgl123` folder on AWS.

- **Database Setup:**
  - Downloaded the database from phpMyAdmin.
  - Added the database to AWS, using the 'm3' suffix.

- **GitHub Integration:**
  - Created a file named `dgl123`.
  - Moved the assignment files to this file.
  - Reconnected GitHub Desktop to ensure synchronization.

- **Testing:**
  - Tested the site by accessing the AWS link.

These steps were taken as part of the Week 11 addition to Assignment 8.

## Week 11 Addition from Assignment 8

# Milestone 4  

## Testing and Identifying Issues:
- There are issues with the sign-in process.
- No proper sign-in security.
- Allows any login without checking if the user has been created already.
- Sessions haven’t been properly set up.

## Define Target Features:
- This app records book entry data for each user and displays their entries.
- I was hoping to also have a journal section with similar features but ran out of time as I have struggled with grasping the language.

## Review and Revise Your Plan:
- I accomplished what I was able to implement the AI suggestions as well as getting the database created and linked to the page and display feature enabled.

## Implement Your Plan and Deploy Your Website:
- I was able to deploy the website to AWS; however, I don’t believe the database is properly linked to the web app.

## Milestone 4 Report:
- Below are screenshots of the website's current functionality.

### Milestone 3:
- Had sign-in and register attached to the database in the backend.
- Hoped to set up securities but couldn’t without repeatedly breaking the site, so had to go back to square one.

### Milestone 4:
- Got the database in the backend set up, entering info in the frontend, and displaying it on the frontend.
- Added a redirect after the book entry but couldn’t tie it with a specific user. That functionality needs to be tied with the sign-in area and I wasn’t able to get it functional.
- My ultimate goal was to have a web app that had some functionality and that would interact with a database, as this is something I have never done before. It has its bugs and unfinished areas, but I am still quite happy with what I accomplished.
- There were quite a few hurdles as I found this language quite hard to grasp with the time constraints and the speed of which we were required to grasp concepts.

### Self-Evaluation - 6.8/8:
- There are some bugs in my code, but I am quite happy with what I have produced and the functionality it has, given my starting point
